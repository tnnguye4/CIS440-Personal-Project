			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
				Welcome viewers! This is my personal website that will detail a little of who I am as well as various ways of contacting me. 
				It will also serve as a business profile for myself. 
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>
				I am currently a student at Arizona State University and I am graduating in December, 2014 with a BS in Computer Information Systems. 
				I apologize for the basic and raw look of this website as this is my first project of designing a website. I welcome all feedback!
				</p>
				<br></br>

			<h2>My Aspirations</h2>
				<p>
				After finishing school at the <a href ="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/"> W.P Carey School of Business</a>, I am aiming to gain a position as a technical systems analyst.
